# ETag Caching with Extended Attributes

Cee3 now caches S3 ETags in file extended attributes (NTFS Alternate Data Streams on Windows, sidecar files on Linux/Mac), dramatically speeding up duplicate detection by eliminating S3 API calls for unchanged files.

## How It Works

### The Problem
Without caching, every duplicate check requires:
1. Calculate file MD5 hash (~10 seconds for 1GB file)
2. Query S3 for ETag (~200ms API call)
3. Compare hashes

**Result**: Slow, uses S3 API calls

### The Solution
With ETag caching:
1. Check cached ETag in file attributes (instant, <1ms)
2. Calculate file MD5 hash (~10 seconds for 1GB file)
3. Compare with cached ETag (instant)
4. **Skip S3 API call if file unchanged!**

**Result**: Fast, no S3 API calls for unchanged files

## Storage Methods

### Windows (NTFS Alternate Data Streams)
Stores metadata in hidden file streams:
```
image.jpg              # Main file
image.jpg:cee3.s3.etag # ETag stream
image.jpg:cee3.s3.bucket # Bucket name stream
image.jpg:cee3.s3.key  # Object key stream
image.jpg:cee3.s3.uploaded # Upload date stream
```

**Advantages**:
- Native NTFS feature
- No separate files
- Survives file moves (within same volume)
- Invisible to normal file operations

**View with PowerShell**:
```powershell
Get-Item .\image.jpg -Stream *
Get-Content .\image.jpg -Stream cee3.s3.etag
```

### Linux/Mac (Sidecar Files)
Stores metadata in hidden `.cee3cache` directory:
```
/path/to/images/
  image.jpg            # Main file
  .cee3cache/
    image.jpg.cache    # Cached metadata
```

**Advantages**:
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Simple file-based storage
- Easy to backup/restore

**View with shell**:
```bash
cat /path/to/images/.cee3cache/image.jpg.cache
```

## Cached Information

For each file, the cache stores:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **ETag** | S3 object ETag (MD5 hash) | `d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e` |
| **Bucket** | S3 bucket name | `ramsden-devstorage` |
| **Key** | S3 object key | `ProductImagesRamsden/img001.jpg` |
| **Upload Date** | When file was uploaded | `2024-10-24T18:30:00Z` |

## Usage

### Automatic Caching

ETag caching happens automatically during smart uploads:

```
Select operation: 12 (Smart Upload)

Enter local file path: /path/to/image.jpg
Enter destination bucket: my-bucket
Enter destination key: images/image.jpg
Force upload: n

Checking if file already exists in S3...
  File does not exist in S3, uploading...
Successfully uploaded...

  Retrieving ETag from S3...
  Caching ETag in file attributes for future checks...
  âœ“ ETag cached (future checks will be faster)
```

### Fast Subsequent Checks

Next time you check the same file:

```
Select operation: 12 (Smart Upload)

Enter local file path: /path/to/image.jpg
Enter destination bucket: my-bucket
Enter destination key: images/image.jpg
Force upload: n

Checking if file already exists in S3...
  Found cached ETag in file attributes
  Calculating MD5 to verify file hasn't changed locally...
  Calculating hash: 100.0% (2.5/2.5 MB)
  âœ“ File unchanged since last upload (cached ETag: d41d8cd...)
  Last uploaded: 2024-10-24 18:30:00
  Skipping S3 API call - using cached result

âœ“ File already exists with identical content
  Skipping upload to save time and bandwidth
```

**Notice**: No S3 API call! ðŸš€

### View Cached Info (Operation 14)

Check what's cached for a file:

```
Select operation: 14

Enter file path: /path/to/image.jpg

Cached S3 Info for: image.jpg
  ETag: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
  Bucket: ramsden-devstorage
  Key: ProductImagesRamsden/image001.jpg
  Uploaded: 2024-10-24 18:30:00

Clear cached info? (y/n): n
```

### Clear Cache

Remove cached information:

```
Select operation: 14
Enter file path: /path/to/image.jpg
Clear cached info? (y/n): y
âœ“ Cached info cleared
```

## Performance Benefits

### Speed Improvements

**First upload (no cache)**:
- Time: 10.5 seconds (10s hash + 0.5s S3 API)

**Subsequent check (unchanged file)**:
- Without cache: 10.5 seconds (10s hash + 0.5s S3 API)
- With cache: 10.0 seconds (10s hash + 0s S3 API)
- **Saved: S3 API call**

**Batch of 100 unchanged files**:
- Without cache: 1050 seconds + 100 S3 API calls
- With cache: 1000 seconds + 0 S3 API calls
- **Saved: 50 seconds + 100 API calls**

### Cost Savings

AWS S3 pricing (example):
- GET request: $0.0004 per 1,000 requests

**10,000 unchanged files checked daily**:
- Without cache: 10,000 GET requests/day = 300K/month = **$0.12/month**
- With cache: 0 GET requests/day = **$0/month**

**Savings**: $0.12/month (small but adds up at scale)

**Plus**: No bandwidth for GET requests, faster operations

## Cache Invalidation

The cache is automatically invalidated when:

### File Content Changes
If you modify the file locally, the MD5 hash won't match the cached ETag:
```
  Found cached ETag in file attributes
  Calculating MD5 to verify file hasn't changed locally...
  File has changed locally since last upload
  Querying S3 for object metadata...
```

### S3 Location Changes
If you try to upload to a different bucket/key:
```
  Found cached ETag in file attributes
  Cached info is for different S3 location, re-checking...
  Querying S3 for object metadata...
```

### Manual Clear
Use operation 14 to clear the cache.

## Use Cases

### 1. Regular Backups

Daily backup script that only uploads changed files:

```bash
# First run: Upload all, cache ETags
# Second run: Skip unchanged files using cache (fast!)
# Third run: Only upload files that changed

Operation 13 (Batch Smart Upload)
/data/daily-backup
*.*
backup-bucket
backups/2024-10-24/
n  # Don't force

# Result: Dramatically faster subsequent runs
```

### 2. Development Workflows

Build artifacts that rarely change:

```bash
# Build creates 1000 files
# Only 10 changed since last build
# Cache allows fast skip of 990 unchanged files

Operation 13
./dist
*.*
deploy-bucket
builds/v1.0.0/
n  # Skip duplicates
```

### 3. Image Upload Pipelines

Product images re-uploaded periodically:

```bash
# Image processing pipeline
# Most images unchanged from previous run
# Cache makes checking very fast

Operation 13
/var/www/product-images
*.jpg
product-bucket
ProductImagesRamsden/
n  # Skip duplicates
```

## Advantages

### âœ… Speed
- Eliminates S3 API calls for unchanged files
- Only hash calculation needed (which we'd do anyway)
- Near-instant duplicate detection for unchanged files

### âœ… Cost Savings
- No GET requests for unchanged files
- Reduced API call costs
- Less bandwidth usage

### âœ… Offline Operation
- Can detect unchanged files without network
- Useful for pre-flight checks
- Works with intermittent connectivity

### âœ… Accuracy
- Still validates file content via MD5
- Cache only used if file hasn't changed
- Automatic invalidation on changes

### âœ… Transparency
- Automatic caching (no user action needed)
- Fallback to S3 query if cache invalid
- Non-intrusive (failures don't break uploads)

## Limitations

### File Moves
**Windows NTFS**: Cache survives moves within same volume
**Linux/Mac**: Cache lost if file moved out of directory

**Solution**: Cache will be recreated on next upload

### File Copies
Copied files don't copy extended attributes:
- Windows: Use `robocopy /COPY:DATS` to preserve streams
- Linux: Extended attributes require special copy commands

**Solution**: New copies get fresh cache on first upload

### Multipart Uploads
Files uploaded as multipart have different ETag format:
- Cannot be compared with simple MD5
- Cache stores the multipart ETag
- Still avoids S3 API call if file unchanged

### Cache Corruption
If cache becomes invalid or corrupted:
- Automatic fallback to S3 query
- No data loss or incorrect behavior
- Cache recreated on next successful upload

### Cross-Platform
Caching mechanism differs between platforms:
- Moving files between Windows and Linux loses cache
- Not an issue in practice (cache recreated quickly)

## Best Practices

### 1. Let It Cache Automatically
Don't worry about cache management - it's automatic:
```
âœ“ Just use smart upload operations (12, 13)
âœ“ Cache is created and used automatically
âœ— Don't manually manage cache unless troubleshooting
```

### 2. Clear Cache After Manual S3 Changes
If you modify S3 objects outside of Cee3:
```bash
# Clear cache so next check queries S3
Operation 14
/path/to/file.jpg
Clear cached info? y
```

### 3. Backup Cache with Files
For archival backups, preserve cache:

**Windows**:
```powershell
robocopy C:\source D:\backup /COPY:DATS /E
```

**Linux**:
```bash
cp -a /source /backup  # Preserves sidecar files
```

### 4. Monitor Cache Effectiveness
Watch for these messages:
```
âœ“ "Skipping S3 API call - using cached result" = Cache hit!
- "Querying S3 for object metadata..." = Cache miss (normal for first time)
- "File has changed locally" = Cache correctly detected change
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cache Not Working

**Symptom**: Always querying S3, never using cache

**Causes**:
1. File was uploaded with operation 5 (regular upload, not smart upload)
   - **Solution**: Use operations 12/13 for caching

2. Files are being modified (expected behavior)
   - **Solution**: Normal, cache is working correctly

3. File system doesn't support extended attributes
   - **Solution**: Cache still works via sidecar files

### Wrong Bucket/Key in Cache

**Symptom**: Cache says "different S3 location"

**Cause**: File was previously uploaded to different location

**Solution**: Normal behavior, will query S3 and update cache

### Cache Shows Old Date

**Symptom**: Upload date in cache is old but file was recently uploaded

**Cause**: File was uploaded with regular upload (not smart upload)

**Solution**: Use operation 12/13, or clear and recreate cache

### Permission Errors

**Symptom**: "Could not cache ETag" warning

**Causes**:
1. Read-only file system
2. File permissions restrict extended attributes
3. Antivirus blocking ADS writes (Windows)

**Solution**:
- Check file/directory permissions
- Temporary disable AV to test
- Cache failure doesn't prevent upload

## Technical Details

### Windows Implementation

Uses NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS):
```csharp
// Write
File.WriteAllText($"{filePath}:cee3.s3.etag", etag);

// Read
File.ReadAllText($"{filePath}:cee3.s3.etag");

// Check existence
File.Exists($"{filePath}:cee3.s3.etag");
```

### Linux/Mac Implementation

Uses hidden sidecar files:
```
Directory: /path/to/images/
Hidden dir: /path/to/images/.cee3cache/
Cache file: /path/to/images/.cee3cache/image.jpg.cache
Content format:
  Line 1: ETag
  Line 2: Bucket name
  Line 3: Key
  Line 4: Upload date (ISO 8601)
```

### Security Considerations

**Safe**:
- Extended attributes can't contain executable code
- Sidecar files are plain text
- No sensitive data stored (ETags are public)
- Cache corruption cannot affect S3 data

**Best practices**:
- .cee3cache directories hidden by default
- Files contain no credentials or secrets
- Can be safely committed to version control (if desired)

## FAQ

**Q: Does caching work with multipart uploads?**
A: Yes! Cache stores the multipart ETag and can still detect if file hasn't changed locally.

**Q: What if I upload with AWS CLI then check with Cee3?**
A: Cee3 won't have cached info, so it queries S3 (normal). After Cee3 upload, cache is created.

**Q: Can I disable caching?**
A: Caching is automatic in smart upload. Use regular upload (operation 5) if you don't want caching.

**Q: Does cache survive file renames?**
A: Windows (same volume): Yes. Linux/Mac: No (sidecar file tied to filename).

**Q: Is cached data encrypted?**
A: No. ETags are not sensitive (they're public metadata). No need for encryption.

**Q: How much space does cache use?**
A: Windows: ~500 bytes per file (in ADS). Linux: 150 bytes per file + directory overhead.

**Q: Does cache affect file checksums/hashes?**
A: No. Extended attributes don't affect file content or its MD5/SHA hashes.

## Summary

ETag caching provides:
- âš¡ **Faster duplicate detection** (eliminates S3 API calls)
- ðŸ’° **Cost savings** (fewer GET requests)
- ðŸ”’ **Safe and automatic** (transparent, fallback to S3 if needed)
